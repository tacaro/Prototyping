# Anaerobic XRD Mount

Getting mineral powders from an anaerobic chamber onto an XRD without oxidation can be difficult. Many XRD manufacturers sell expensive anaerobic XRD mounts. This is intended to be a cheap, low-background, alternative.

## Fabrication

Delete the instructional box and annotations before sending to the laser cutter. Cut the design in vector mode along the red lines and raster mode for the black area. The black circle represents the 'well' that sample will be loaded into. Every laser cutter is different, so you'll have to use your own judgement as to the depth of the well. For me, it took 5 iterations at 100% power, 50% speed, to get an appropriate depth. I then used a 12% power, 50% speed, to smooth out the bottom of the sample well. In general, I'd highly recommend using low power rasters to clean out more rough high power cuts.

The acrylic sheet should be 0.175 mm thick. To seal the two halves of the sandwich together, a liquid adhesive must be applied in an anaerobic atmosphere. We have had luck with transparent InstaDri nail polish. Apply some to the outer "donut" of the sample well, press tightly and seal with a clamp (or for a low-cost option, binder clips work well for this). Once the inner adhesive has sealed, apply two layers to the outer surface of the sandwich to seal any remaining cracks. We've kept minerals from oxidizing inside this holder for weeks.
