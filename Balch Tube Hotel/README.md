# Balch Tube Hotel

Sometimes you'd just like to have a ton of Balch tubes laying on their side in an incubator, but you quickly run out of space. Here's a simple, cheap, balch tube rack "hotel" that can hold tubes both vertically and horizontally.

**WARNING**: Acrylic (PMMA) is a flammable plastic. Do not incubate at high temperatures. Do not autoclave. Keep away from flame sources.

## Fabrication

Delete the instructional box and annotations before sending to the laser cutter. Cut the design in vector mode along the red lines and raster mode for the black area. The honeycomb structure on the backstop is an artistic choice.

The acrylic sheet should be 3.175 mm thick. A liquid adhesive should be applied to the joints to ensure that they stay together (InstaDri nail polish has worked well for us). We have incubated these racks at temperatures up to 65ËšC with no issue.
