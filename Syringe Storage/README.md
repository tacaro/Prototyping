# Syringe Holder

In organic chemistry workspaces, we often use gas-tight syringes. It is helpful to have a convenient place to store these syringes in a way that is relatively clean. This gas-tight syringe holder is made for Hamilton brand gas tight syringes but is amenable to syringes of similar length and diameter.

## Fabrication

Delete the instructional box and annotations before sending to the laser cutter. Cut the design in vector mode along the red lines and raster mode for the black text. The acrylic sheet should be 2.5 mm thick. I'd recommend using lower power settings on the vector cut to decrease the kerf, which will allow a tighter fit of the parts. If needed, can use an adhesive to prevent the parts from losing grip with each other (I used InstaDri nail polish).
