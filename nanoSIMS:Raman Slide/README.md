# nanoSIMS/Raman Slide

In order to co-register measurements acquired on a Cameca 50L nanoSIMS instrument with those of a Horiba LabRAM Raman Spectrometer, we needed a sample mount that was compatible with both instruments. The chief constraints were
- Must be able to fit the nanoSIMS mount (7x7 mm)
- Must have an aluminum surface (not glass) that is amenable to Raman spectroscopy.

We can engrave aluminum-coated slides that are typically used for Raman spectroscopy to fit our needs.

## Options

- aluminum_slide: A laser engraver pattern for creating the 7x7 aluminum-coated glass "coupons".
- al_coupon_holder: A three layer acrylic container for safely holding the slides.
- slide_mount_rgb: An acrylic mount for the Aluminum coupons.
- slide_mount_rgb: An acrylic mount for the Aluminum coupons but with no sharpie label area.

## Fabrication

Using a laser engraver, engrave the grid pattern onto a standard aluminum-coated microscope slide. Use a test cut to ensure that the laser pattern is centered on the al-coated glass slide (can use a pre-cut on paper or masking tape to ensure this; place the al-coated slide in the hole cut in the tape/paper).

Using a lens paper-coated weight (we used a heating block, for example), break the columns of 7x7 squares along their engravings. Then, break the individual squares from the columns.

**NOTE**: Breaking glass, even with pre-cut engravings, carries inherent risk. Use proper PPE including eye protection and gloves; dispose of any glass shards in broken glassware waste.
